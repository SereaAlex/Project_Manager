This is just a Uni project I'm working on.

The program is for automatization purposes in linux without the need of typing too many comands for anything.
It's not perfect, quite far from it. But I'm learning from my mistakes and will make it better in the near future.

For this program to run, it needs two libraries. Termcolor and Inquirer.
To install them, type in the terminal:
pip install termcolor
pip install inquirer

Inside the program you can find diffrent types of terminal commands.
You can check them in the Help section.

It's open to anyone who wants to check and I'm open for sugestions.
Is written in Python and bash here and there.

Hope you enjoy it!
